        <p> The application will be built using Node.js on the server-side of a movie web application. </p>
        <p> The application will utilize MongoDB for storing data and Monngoose for the Business Logic Layer.</p>
        <p> The application will be deployed to Heroku.</p>
        <p> This interactive web application will allow users to sign up, build/edit a profile, and compile a list of their favorite movies </p>
        <p> Once a user is signed up, the application will give users access to information about movie genres, directors, and movies themselves. </p>
